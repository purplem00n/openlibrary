# Storybook

We are documenting our components [here](internetarchive.github.io/openlibrary).

## Deployment Process

We use GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy new stories.  The action is triggered when a branch containing changes to the `/stories` directory is merged into `master`.
This process can also be manually triggered via the Actions [page](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/actions).
